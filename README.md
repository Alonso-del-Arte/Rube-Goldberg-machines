# Rube Goldberg machines

This is going to be an assortment of complicated programs that do very simple 
things. But it's not enough for the programs to be inefficient, they should also 
be amusing in their inefficiency.

## Requirements

* Java 21
* JUnit 5
* JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (not necessarily Ultimate, as Community Edition should 
work fine for this project)
* IDEA's proprietary build tool, not Maven, SBT or any such overly complicated 
build tool
